> **NOTE:** This repository contains samples for Discore 3.x and 4.x. Samples for newer versions can be found in [the main repository](https://github.com/Francessco121/Discore).

# Discore.Samples
This repository contains tested sample projects for [Discore](https://github.com/BundledSticksInkorperated/Discore). 

Each sample is organized by Discore version and contains its own README explaining setup and usage.

## Versioning Notice
If the version you need a sample for is not listed, assume that the newest version below that version that has a sample will work (e.g. the v4.0.0 examples will work on v4.1.2). Samples are only updated to address breaking changes and bugs.
